        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <a href="https://banana-fish.fandom.com/wiki/Ash_Lynx#History">
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/banana-fish/images/0/0a/Ash_resting_his_head_on_his_hand_in_the_intro.jpg/revision/latest/?cb=20190121235307" alt=""></a>
        <p>Ash grew up in <b>Cape Cod, Massachusetts</b>. His mother left him as a young baby at the care of his father.
            His father relinquishes Ash's care to Griffin, his older brother, who raises him. When Ash is <b>six years
                old</b>, Griffin is called to serve in the army and is sent to Iraq (Vietnam in the manga). When Ash is
            seven years old he is raped by his Little League coach. When his father went to report the sexual assault,
            the police believed his rapist to be not guilty, as he was a 'big shot'. His father told Ash that next time
            he should let the assault happen but then ask to be paid. After Ash is abused several more times by the same
            man, he grabs his father's gun without his knowledge and kills his rapist, at the age of 8. The police found
            bones of children in his basement, and the case causes notoriety. Ash's aggressor becomes known as the Blue
            Beard of Cape Cod. Ash was found not guilty in the eyes of the law but becomes the talk of the small town.
            Ash's father decides to send him away to his aunt, but before he is able, Ash runs away from home.</p>
        <p>As a destitute child, he is captured by men who traffic with children for prostitution. Ash is sent to work
            at Club Cod, a child sex trafficking establishment operating under the guise of a restaurant owned by
            <i>Mafia Don Dino Golzine</i>. At Club Cod, he learned how to entice customers using his charisma, and he
            would in due time catch the personal eye of Golzine himself, who opted to keep Ash as a personal "pet" or
            sex slave. Under Golzine he is "cultured" and trained as a member of the upper class: made to taste various
            kinds of wine, learn proper table manners, and receive an outstanding education. This education includes
            instruction in hand and fire combat from the world's most recognized teachers, one of which was
            <i>Blanca</i>.</p>
        <p>At <i>14</i> Ash falls in love with a girl, but she is killed before anything develops when she is thought to
            be his girlfriend. At age fifteen Ash is sent to juvenile detention for killing three people. This is where
            he meets Shorter Wong, who would become his close friend and help him unify the gang territories of lower
            Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Around the age of fifteen or sixteen, Ash finds his brother, Griffin Callenreese, in a run-down hospital for
            veterans from Iraq, and decides to take care of him. At age seventeen, Ash has grown to unite a great number
            of gangs under his command and becomes both a feared and admired leader in Manhattan, compelling fierce
            loyalty.</p>
